    "entry": "Started the week with another frustrating call to customer service. I can't believe how rude the representatives were. Why is it so hard to get decent service these days? The kitchen renovation is coming along, but it's slow going. Peanuts seems tired today; he's moving slower than usual. I baked a chocolate cake to cheer myself up. Clive and I had an argument about Peanuts; he just doesn’t understand how much Peanuts means to me."

    "entry": "Visited the hardware store for more kitchen supplies. The young clerk was so unhelpful, barely looked up from his phone. What has happened to basic manners? The tiles I picked out are perfect. Peanuts didn’t seem interested in learning new tricks this week. It’s hard watching him slow down. Clive made a snide comment about Peanuts not pulling his weight. I made a lemon cake to destress."

    "entry": "Another week, another battle with customer service. This time it was the cable company. They really need to train their staff better. On the home front, the new countertops were installed, and they look fantastic. Peanuts managed to do a simple trick, but he’s definitely slowing down. Made some cupcakes; baking always lifts my spirits. Clive didn’t like the cupcakes; we argued again."

More delays. Peanuts is struggling with his usual energy. I made a lemon drizzle cake to take my mind off things. Clive didn’t notice my efforts in the kitchen, which hurt."

    "entry": "Had a run-in with a group of teenagers at the park. They were so loud and disrespectful. The contractor finally started fixing the cabinet color issue. Peanuts seems very tired lately. He still wags his tail when I bake, so I made a batch of cookies just for him. Clive complained about the mess in the kitchen; we argued again."

    "entry": "The renovation is dragging on. I had to deal with another rude delivery person. Why can’t people be more polite? The backsplash is almost complete, and it looks amazing. Peanuts doesn’t have the same enthusiasm for tricks anymore. I made a carrot cake, hoping to lift both our spirits. Clive said he doesn’t like carrot cake; I feel so unappreciated."

    "entry": "Had to call customer service about a billing error. Surprise, surprise, the representative was incredibly rude. The kitchen is starting to look like a kitchen again, though. Peanuts and I spent more time cuddling than training this week. I baked some oatmeal cookies; the house smells wonderful. Clive ate a few cookies without commenting, which is the closest to a compliment I’ve gotten lately."
